## Overview

### The challenge

This is a layout challenge a combination of rows and columns to get the intended design layout

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Looking at the design image and thinking about its structure helped in creating it. At first I couldn't figure out how the four boxes were positioned like that and going from desktop to mobile the amount of coding needed to get them in that position. It can't be complicated and over coded. Then, I remembered that with divs, I can have multiple inside each other with rows and columns, so the solution was very simple.
